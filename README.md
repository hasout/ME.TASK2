# Smart Food Storage Automation Robot

## Project Overview
This project involves designing an automated robotic arm system to handle food materials inside a warehouse without human intervention. The robot performs item pick-and-place operations using a custom-built mechanical arm.

## Components
- Stable base for mounting the arm
- Rotating joint to allow horizontal movement
- Extendable mechanical arm
- Gripper (holder) to pick up items
- Tray/track representing the storage area
- Sensors for object and path detection

## Execution Algorithm
1. Power on and initialize all components.
2. Detect the position of the food item using sensors.
3. Move the arm to the item’s location.
4. Activate the gripper to hold the item.
5. Move the item to the storage area.
6. Release the item in the target location.
7. Return to the home position.
8. Repeat until all items are processed.

## Working Envelope
- 180° horizontal base rotation
- Vertical arm movement depending on size
- Approx. 30 cm reach from the base
- Gripper movement: ±90° for flexibility

## Requirements
- Fully autonomous operation
- Safe handling with no collisions
- Accurate and repeatable movements
- Easily adaptable to different warehouse layouts

## Output
- Functional robot to automate material transfer
- Minimizes human labor
- Enhances storage efficiency
